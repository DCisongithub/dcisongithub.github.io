1)
Yes, I can create a HTML code for a table with one row and two columns that can be extended by a button above the table. The button should have a text input and should add the text to the table when the button is pressed. Here is an example of such a table:

This code creates a table with one row and two columns, and a button above the table with a text input. The text input allows the user to enter text, and when the button is pressed, the text is added to the table as a new row. It will add to the last row of the table
You can modify this code to suit your specific needs.


2)
Yes, I can add a bold line to separate the button and the table, and I can also change the color of the table lines to black. Here is an updated version of the previous code that includes these changes:
This code uses a <hr> tag with a border style of 2px solid black to create a bold line between the button and the table. The table is also given a border-collapse: collapse style, which makes the table lines appear solid and black.
You can change the thickness of the line by modifying the width of the border in the hr tag and in the table tag.

3)
Yes, I can rename "Column 1" to "Ich brauche..." and "Column 2" to "Kommentar" and change the text on the button to a plus icon.
Here is an updated version of the previous code that includes these changes:

In this version, I have replaced the text of the button with an <i> tag that uses the class fa fa-plus , which is a class from font-awesome library and this class will show a plus sign. Also I have replaced the text of the first and second column of the table with "Ich brauche..." and "Kommentar".

Note that in this version, the font-awesome library is not included in the code, you need to include it in your HTML file if you want to show the plus icon.
You can visit the font-awesome website to get the link to include it in your HTML file.
And you can also customize the plus icon as per your requirement.


4)
Yes, I can provide you with the HTML code for a plus sign using the Font Awesome library.

Here's an example of how you can include the Font Awesome library in your HTML file, and use the plus icon:

In this code, the Font Awesome library is included by linking to the CSS file hosted on a CDN.
And then you can use the class fa fa-plus in an <i> tag to display a plus sign.

You can also customize the icon by adding some more classes from font-awesome library.
Please make sure to include the correct version of the Font Awesome library that you are using in your project.

Please note that, you must have an internet connection in order to include the library via CDN link.
If you don't have internet connection, you can download the font awesome library and include the css file in your project to make it work offline.
