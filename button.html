<!--
This code creates a div element with a class of icon-button, which is used as a container for the button.
The position property is set to absolute so that the button can be positioned in a specific location on the screen.
The top and right properties are used to position the button in the top-right corner.
The display: flex; ,flex-direction: column; and align-items: center; properties used to center the content of the div vertically.
Then there are three span elements inside the div with a width and height of 2px and a background color of #000 (black) to create the lines. The margin is used to separate the lines by 4px.
You can customize the styling and functionality of the button as desired.

I added two CSS properties, border and border-radius, to the .icon-button class to create a frame around the button.
The border property is used to add a 2px solid black border around the button.
The border-radius property is used to make the corners of the border rounded. The value of 10px is used to make the corners rounded by 10px.
You can adjust the border width, color, and radius as desired.

I added a padding property with a value of 5px to the .icon-button class. This will add a 5px space between the content of the button and the border so that the lines will end 5px before the frame.
You can adjust the value of padding to change the position of lines in relation to the frame.
